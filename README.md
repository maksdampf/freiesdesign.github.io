It was written for the degree of ‚Diplom Designer‘ at the college of
fine arts ‚Hochschule für Bildende Künste Hamburg‘.
It is still in german, although an english translation is planned.

What still needs to be done to this website:
- clean up divs and use more relative values instead of px
- improve mobile view (font-size too small, too much width of some
elements)
- start translation to english
